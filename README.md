# Oracle One Portfolio Challenge

## A challenge from the Oracle One to front-end students, create a portfolio using HTML CSS and Javascript.

This project design was sent on Figma by the Oracle ONE team, and the challenge was to create it using HTML, CSS, and JS, but I have already done so much using CSS, and that is why I opted to use SASS/SCSS instead of CSS this time.
I've never built anything using SASS, and that is why it took me 3 days to build the entire website with all the responsiveness using this preprocessor because I learned a lot about `@mixins`, `$variables`, nesting and much more. It was fun!

The worst thing that happened when I was building the website was the `<form>` validation. I wanted to improve the form design using input transitions and label animations, but that came with a lot of problems when I started to code in JavaScript because, due to the attributes `:focus and :valid` I created in SCSS, my JS didn't work well.

## How did I do that!? You can see the step-by-step process below.

* Analyze the design details.
* Build the entire HTML using semantic tags and link the CSS and JavaScript to it.
* Install SASS and create the relationship between SCSS and CSS files.
* Write the SCSS style codes.
* Validate the form inputs.
* Ensure responsiveness.

## About SCSS
To create the relationship between SCSS and CSS files you need to use the command "sass --watch something.scss:something.css" in the terminal. This command automatically updates the <ins>something</ins>.css file when we save changes to the <ins>something</ins>.scss file. (It also creates the <ins>something</ins>.css file if it doesn't exist).
